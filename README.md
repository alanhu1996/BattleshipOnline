# BattleshipOnline

This is a online battleship game built in Java. 
Currently, it supports 2-player games and also player vs bot games. 

Current features:
* Basic game is playable.
* Individual accounts for each player.
* Bot is working.
* 2-player mode is working, however buggy.
* Games can be saved into a txt file.
* Reloading saved games works.

Features that still need work:
* Must restructure the code to be more object oriented. The code is a mess right now, need structuring because i did not feel like using objects at the time this was coded.
* Allowing 2+ players to connect.
* Have the server handle multiple games at once.
* Add password to user accounts.
* Make bot AI smarter.
